# Spatial correlation estimation

This repository provides Matlab scripts to model spatial correlation in earthquake ground motions, and quantify estimation uncertainty. Further documentation can be found in the following paper:

Baker, Jack. W., and Chen, Yilin. (2020). “Ground motion spatial correlation fitting methods and estimation uncertainty.” (in review).

The script MAIN_script.m in the root directory will produce the data and figures used in the above manuscript.

The script MAIN_variogram.m in the "simple fitting example" folder will perform a very simple computation of a semivariogram and model fit, to illustrate the basic mechanics of geostatical calculations.
